  'Bike Component Wear Tracker'

  Cyclists are now able to keep track of the number of hours or miles of use that they are getting out of servicable/wear components, so that they can keep their bikes riding safely and smoothly!

  Summary:

  It's easy to loose track of how much time you've spent on the wearable parts on your bikes. Suspenstion components on your mountain bike, for example, are supposed to be serviced after every 50 hours of use, but most riders let it go until compromised performance becomes evident and in some cases it may be too late to salvage a very expensive component. Or, you might kill your whole drive train becasuse you didn't realize that you had ridden thousands of miles on the same chain. With Bike Component Wear Tracker, save money, stay safe, and keep your bike riding optimally!

  Problem:

  Ride tracking apps, such as Strava, can keep track of the mileage that you put on a bike, but they don't keep track of the mileage that you put on the bike's components, which the more useful and important information to have!

  Solution:

  Keep track of the mileage put on chains, brakepads, tires, cassettes, and chainrings, as well as the number of weeks since adding fresh sealant to tubeless tires, and the nubmer of hours spent on suspension products and dropper seatposts since last service!

  Quote from app creator:

  "Now your bikes are going to be riding better than ever, you're going to have more confidence in their states, which translates into more confidence and better performance in your own riding!"

  How to Get Started:

  If your bike is brand new, just enter the name of the bike, and regularly update mileage and time info from the ride tracking app of your choice. If notice that it's time to change a part, set the mileage back to zero on that part, and store the times spent on retired components to determine trends in part lifespans specific to your riding. For parts where the manufacturer recommends a specific number of hours or miles on the component before service or replacement, enter the number and the app will keep you notified of when it's time for service or replacement.

  Customer quote:
